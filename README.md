# Description:
Shopwit is an E-Commerce app for small stores that clients can buy their products.
\
&nbsp;
# Tech Stack:
- [React/React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/
)
- [Material-ui](https://mui.com/) version v4
- [React-Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) for navigation
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for transactions

\
&nbsp;
# Tool Used for the Project
- [Github](https://github.com) Version control

\
&nbsp;

# Technical decisions:
The reason why I used Redux as state management are:

-  The state of the app is needed in many places.
-   The logic to update the state is complex.
